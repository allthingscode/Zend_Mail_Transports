Zend_Mail_Transports
====================

This is a collection of various transports to be used with Zend_Mail.

They all interact with web servers, rather than SMTP servers.
While they are crude in nature, they come in really handy when you 
need to send email from a system that does not readily have access to
or support SMTP - due to firewalls or local libraries.

Consequently, performance is not suitable for mass mailing, 
but no-one likes spam anyway.
(Please don't use this for spam!)
